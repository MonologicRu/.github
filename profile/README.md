# Welcome to the MONOLOGIC Open Source Community!

## WHO WE ARE & WHAT WE DO

MONOLOGIC has been building an open-source infrastructure maintenance ecosystem since 2015. Drawing on the work of others, we craft solutions based on open-source software and community-driven practices. As active contributors, we value collaboration, continuous improvement, and the sharing of both software and ideas.

## LET'S EXCHANGE IDEAS!

Open source is central to everything we do. As active contributors, we deeply value community involvement in our projects. Our goal is to make our work, whether complete or in progress, easily accessible to everyone. We use GitHub to share code, document our process, and provide useful resources. By inviting you to submit pull requests, we encourage you to help shape and improve our projects. Your suggestions, ideas, and contributions are always welcome!

Please note that all participation is governed by our [code of conduct](https://www.monologic.ru/code-of-conduct/).
